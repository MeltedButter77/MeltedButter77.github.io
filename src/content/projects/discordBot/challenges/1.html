    <h2>Storing Information</h2>

    <h3>Aim</h3>
    <p>
        When a user joins a specific, pre-determined voice channel (channel hub), I want to create
        a new voice channel (temporary voice channel) and move them into it. When the user leaves
        that channel, the temporary voice channel should be deleted.
    </p>

    <h3>Initial Plan</h3>
    <p>
        Originally, I was planning to only store the channel hubs' IDs and keep the temporary voice
        channels' IDs in a list in memory. However, this approach had a major flaw. If the bot
        restarted or crashed, it would stop tracking any existing temporary voice channels. This
        meant admins would have to manually delete any leftover temporary channels.
    </p>

    <h3>Improved Solution</h3>
    <p>
        To fix this issue, I decided to store temporary voice channel IDs in a database as well.
        The only question was: which type of database? This lead me to lightly research different
        types of databases. For my use case, I ended up choosing SQLite, as it's a simple and
        lightweight solution that works well. Since it's stored in a file, I could view and query
        the database easily through my IDE, which helped a lot during the learning process.
    </p>

    <h3>Refactoring for Maintainability</h3>
    <p>
        As the project grew, manually managing the database queries became messy and hard to track.
        To make things cleaner, I went back and created a class to abstract away the database
        interactions. This allowed me to reuse code for both storing and retrieving data, making
        things much more maintainable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another interesting problem I ran into was how to handle adding new columns to the database
        as I introduced more functionality. To solve this, I wrote a method that ensured the tables
        were up to date by checking for missing columns and adding them as needed. I kept a
        dictionary of new columns to track what needed to be added if the database was created
        before certain changes. This meant that if someone else was hosting the bot and wanted
        to update, the new columns would be automatically added to their existing database,
        ensuring forward compatibility without any manual intervention.
    </p>

    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>
        The bot now consistently handles temporary voice channels without leaving any orphaned
        ones behind, even after restarts or crashes. SQLite proved to be reliable and low-maintenance,
        and the abstraction layer made the overall codebase cleaner and easier to work with. Users
        were moved seamlessly between channels, and admins no longer had to worry about manual cleanups.
    </p>

    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
    <p>
        I learned that even small-scale features can benefit from persistent storage and a bit
        of foresight into failure cases. I also gained a much deeper understanding of working
        with SQLite in a real project and how to abstract logic in a way that improves
        maintainability. Most importantly, I saw the value of planning for edge cases, especially
        in bots that are expected to run 24/7.
