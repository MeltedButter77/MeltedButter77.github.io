<h2>How I Make Things</h2>
<p>
    All of my projects are made completely from scratch. I don't use templates,
    tutorials, or large frameworks. Almost all of my knowledge is self-taught
    through trial and error and I've spent hours learning new languages,
    frameworks, and tools. My biggest resources are official documentation,
    online examples like stake overflow, and the results of my mistakes.
</p>
<h2>Project Quality</h2>
<p>
    I do not like to create janky results. I want other coders to look at my code
    and be able to see that I've put in the time to learn the best way to do
    something for my use case. I want to share my knowledge in a way that is easy to
    understand and build upon.
