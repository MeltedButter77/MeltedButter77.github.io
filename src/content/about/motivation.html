<h2>What drives me</h2>
<p>
    Curiosity has always been my main driver, I find myself jumping into
    systems, tools, or ideas simply to experiment.
    I've spent hours figuring out how to host a Minecraft server on my own
    linux server and learning how to interact with web APIs, Iâ€™m rarely satisfied
    with surface-level understanding. That mindset led me to explore new
    programming languages, build automation scripts for my everyday life.
    I don't wait to be taught; I tinker, break things, fix them, and grow.
