    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hi, I'm <strong>MeltedButter</strong>, well that's my online name. I live in {{location}}
        and I'm student and aspiring software developer with a strong passion for technology, 
        problem-solving, and self-driven learning. Since 2021, I've built a range of 
        personal projects, often diving into new languages and frameworks like Python, C++, 
        and JavaScript with no formal instruction, just curiosity and persistence.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whether I'm coding a Discord bot, running my own home server, or mentoring others 
        in robotics, I enjoy the challenge of turning ideas into functioning software. 
        I value learning by doing and love sharing knowledge with peers. Outside of coding, 
        I'm active in {{hobbies}}.
