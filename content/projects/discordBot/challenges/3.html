    <h2>Displaying Information to Users</h2>

    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>
        In previous projects, I implemented many commands that displayed information
        to users. However, this approach often left users uncertain about their permissions
        and capabilities within their voice channels, as well as unsure how to use the bot
        effectively.
    </p>

    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <p>
        To address this, I created a persistent message in each channelâ€™s associated text channel.
        This message displayed key information about the voice channel and included interactive
        buttons to modify the temporary voice channel settings. This approach provided users
        with immediate, clear feedback on what actions they could take and how to control their
        channels. While this worked well for basic management, I wanted to further improve the
        system to provide a more dynamic and intuitive way to lock or hide channels, as well as
        to whitelist or blacklist specific users from accessing public channels.
    </p>

    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p>
        The result was a clear, user-friendly interface that gave channel owners greater control
        over who can view or use their temporary voice channels. This improved user experience
        and reduced confusion by making permissions and channel status instantly visible and
        easily adjustable.
