    <h2>Handling Concurrency</h2>

    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>
        One tricky issue I faced was dealing with users rapidly joining and leaving the channel
        hub, especially in quick succession. Since the bot responds to voice state updates, multiple
        overlapping events could trigger simultaneouslyâ€”leading to race conditions. For example,
        the bot might try to create a new temporary channel while also trying to delete it, or it
        might attempt to move a user to a channel that no longer exists.
    </p>

    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <p>
        To prevent this, I implemented checks to verify the current voice state before taking any
        action. I also added small delays and used flags to ensure that only one operation (like
        creating or deleting a channel) could occur at a time for each user. Where necessary, I
        wrapped critical sections in try/except blocks to handle potential edge cases gracefully,
        like trying to delete a channel that was already deleted or moving a user who had already
        disconnected.
    </p>

    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p>
        These changes made the bot much more stable and resilient under real-world use, especially
        in servers where users frequently join and leave voice channels quickly. It also helped
        prevent ghost channels or unexpected errors due to overlapping events.
