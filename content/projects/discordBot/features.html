<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Automatic Channel Creation & Cleanup</strong> <br> Channels are created when needed and automatically
        deleted when empty—eliminating channel bloat and keeping the server clean.
    </li>
    <li><strong>User-Controlled Permissions</strong> <br> Users can lock their temporary channels, hide them from
        others, or create personalized access lists (whitelist/blacklist)—all from a persistent control panel.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Persistent Interface</strong> <br> Each channel has an associated text panel with buttons and live
        information, helping users understand and manage their voice channel with ease—no commands needed.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Crash-Resistant State Management</strong> <br> Channel data is saved to a local database (SQLite),
        ensuring the bot can recover and clean up correctly even after restarts or crashes.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Built for Real Use</strong> <br> The bot was designed to run 24/7, respond to rapid user activity, and
        operate reliably even in high-turnover environments with multiple overlapping events.
