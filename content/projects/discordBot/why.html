<h2>Project Overview: Why I Built This Bot</h2>
<p>
    In active Discord communities, voice channels can quickly become cluttered with unused rooms, making navigation
    confusing and discouraging user engagement. At the same time, static channels offer little flexibility or control to
    the users actually in them.
</p>
<p> I built <strong>Dr Robotnic</strong> to solve this. The bot dynamically manages
    voice channels based on real user activity. When a user joins a “channel hub,” a temporary voice channel is
    automatically created for them. When they leave, it disappears. No admin cleanup required. On top of that, users have
    full control over their temporary voice room, including the ability to hide it, lock it, or manage access.
</p>
<p>
    The goal was to create a clean, user-friendly, and self-moderating voice channel experience. One that empowers users,
    reduces moderator overhead, and keeps the server tidy and inviting.
