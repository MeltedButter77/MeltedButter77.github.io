<h2>Impact</h2>
<p>
    Since launch, <strong>Dr Robotnic</strong> has been installed in over <strong>185 Discord servers</strong>, serving
    more than <strong>40,000 users</strong> across a wide range of communities. </p> <p> This bot has solved real
    problems for real people: over a dozen server admins and users have personally joined the support server to offer
    feedback and thanks. Many now rely on it daily to reduce moderation load and enhance the user experience. </p> <p>
    The project is <strong>self-hosted, free, and open-source</strong>. By making the codebase public and continuously
    improving it, Iâ€™ve allowed others to learn from, modify, or contribute to the project, while I maintain reliable
    uptime and handle all server costs myself.
