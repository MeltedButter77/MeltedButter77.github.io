<h2>What drives me</h2>
<p>
    Curiosity has always been my compass, I find myself deep-diving into
    systems, tools, or ideas simply because I need to know how they work.
    Whether it’s figuring out how to host a Minecraft server from my own
    hardware or learning how to interact with web APIs, I’m rarely satisfied
    with surface-level understanding. That mindset led me to explore new
    programming languages, build automation scripts, and even experiment
    with Linux system administration, often before I had a specific need
    or use case. I don't wait to be taught; I tinker, break things, fix
    them, and grow.
