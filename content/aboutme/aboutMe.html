<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
    Hi, I'm <strong>MeltedButter</strong>, well that's my online pseudonym. I live near <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/11381689" target=”_blank”>Adelaide, Australia</a>,
    I am a student and aspiring software developer with a strong passion for technology,
    problem-solving, and self-driven learning. Since 2021, I've built a range of
    personal projects, often diving into new languages and frameworks like Python, C++,
    and JavaScript with no formal instruction, just curiosity and persistence.
</p>
<p>
    I've coded Discord bots, run my own home server, mentored others
    in robotics and I continue to enjoy the challenge of turning ideas into functioning technology.
    I value learning by doing and love sharing knowledge with peers. Outside of coding,
    I'm active in Robotics, and Language Learning.
