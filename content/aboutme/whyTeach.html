<h2>Teaching Others</h2>
<p>
    My love for coding evolved into a love for teaching others about the systems I explore.
    Iâ€™ve volunteered hundreds of hours helping others learn to program throughout high school,
    mentoring younger students in both robotics and coding clubs,
    and creating accessible examples to explain tricky concepts. I enjoy the
    challenge of explaining something as clearly as possible. Teaching pushes
    me to be a better developer: I have to understand my tools, communicate clearly,
    and stay curious enough to keep learning myself.
    Helping others grow is just as rewarding as building something new.
