<h2>From Tinkering to Teaching</h2>
<p>
    My love for coding naturally evolved into a love for teaching.
    I’ve volunteered hundreds of hours helping others learn to program,
    mentoring younger students in robotics, running my school’s coding club,
    and creating accessible examples to explain tricky concepts. I enjoy the
    challenge of explaining something clearly just as much as I enjoy solving a
    tough coding problem. Teaching pushes me to be a better developer: I have to
    understand my tools, communicate clearly, and stay curious enough to keep
    learning myself. Helping others grow is just as rewarding as building something new.
