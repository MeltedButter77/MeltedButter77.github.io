<h2>Life Outside Computers</h2>
<p>
    Though I spend a lot of time immersed in code, I try to keep life well-balanced.
    I enjoy learning Spanish, spending time outdoors hiking or cycling, and
    playing local multiplayer games with friends, especially chaotic couch party games
    where everyone’s laughing in the same room. I’ve also played volleyball, tennis, and hockey competitively
    during school. Travel has played a big part in shaping my outlook too. I’ve lived on
    two continents, explored southern Africa, and been part of a cultural exchange to Spain.
    These experiences help me stay open-minded, adaptable, and always ready for something new.
