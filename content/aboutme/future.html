<h2>What I’m Building Towards</h2>
<p>
    Right now, I’m focused on improving my skills and gaining hands-on
    experience in the tech industry. I’m especially drawn to roles where I
    can both build things and help others, whether that’s through software
    development, support engineering, or technical education. Long-term,
    I’d love to work on tools that lower the barrier to entry for new developers
    or empower communities through accessible tech.

    I don’t just want to build software that works. I want to build software that matters.
